                <h1>TRUCK ART in Pakistan</h1>
                <p>Truck art in South Asia is a popular form of regional decoration, with trucks featuring elaborate
                    floral patterns and calligraphy.[1][2] It is especially common in Pakistan and India.[3]</p>
                <h2> "Jingle truck" origin</h2>
                <p> The term "jingle truck" is military slang that was coined by American troops serving in Afghanistan,
                    although it may also date back to the British colonial period. The term came to be because of the
                    jingling sound that the trucks make due to the chains and pendants hanging from the bumpers of the
                    vehicles.[4]</p>
                <h3> Practice</h3>

                    Many trucks and buses are highly customized and decorated by their owners. External truck decoration
                    can cost thousands of dollars.[5] The decoration often contains elements that remind the truck
                    drivers of home, since they may be away from home for months at a time.[6] The art is a mode of
                    expression for the truck drivers.[7] Decoration may include structural changes, paintings,
                    calligraphy and ornamental-decor like mirror work on the front and back of vehicles and wooden
                    carvings on the truck doors. Depictions of various historical scenes and poetic verses are also
                    common.[8] Outfitting is often completed at a coach workshop.[9] Chains and pendants often dangle
                    off the front bumper.[10] In India, motifs depicting eagles, kites, cow nuzzling calf and nazar
                    battu, and catchphrases like "Horn OK Please", "Blow Horn" and "Use Dipper at Night" are frequently
                    seen.[11] Religious iconography, poetry and political logos are also common.[3][12]

            <h2>Sculpture</h2>
            <p>an artisti c form in which hard or plastic materials are worked into three-dimensional art objects. The
                designs may be embodied in freestanding objects, in reliefs on surfaces, or in environments ranging from
                tableaux to contexts that envelop the spectator. An enormous variety of media may be used, including
                clay, wax, stone, metal, fabric, glass, wood, plaster, rubber, and random “found” objects. Materials may
                be carved, modeled, molded, cast, wrought, welded, sewn, assembled, or otherwise shaped and combined</p>
            <h2>Elaboration for This Art</h2>
            <p>Sculpture is not a fixed term that applies to a permanently circumscribed category of objects or sets of
                activities. It is, rather, the name of an art that grows and changes and is continually extending the
                range of its activities and evolving new kinds of objects. The scope of the term was much wider in the
                second half of the 20th century than it had been only two or three decades before, and in the fluid
                state of the visual arts in the 21st century nobody can predict what its future extensions are likely to
                be.</p>
            <h3>Illustration</h3>
            <p>Before the 20th century, sculpture was considered primarily an art of solid form, or mass. It is true
                that the negative elements of sculpture—the voids and hollows within and between its solid forms—have
                always been to some extent an integral part of its design, but their role was a secondary one. In a
                great deal of modern sculpture, however, the focus of attention has shifted, and the spatial aspects
                have become dominant. Spatial sculpture is now a generally accepted branch of the art of sculpture.</p>

            <h2>Muslim Architecture</h2>

            <p> Architecture is a centuries-old category of architecture that is rooted in the principles of Islam. The
                striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes Islamic buildings
                include some of the most awe-inspiring built structures on Earth.</p>
            > <h2> History of Islamic Architecture</h2>

            <p>Islamic architecture refers to a style of architecture that was created as a physical manifestation of
                the principles of Islam by the Mohammedan (people of Islamic faith) in the 7th century, a tradition that
                continues to the present day. The building that is most frequently associated with Islamic architecture
                is the mosque, or Muslim place of worship.
            </p>

            <p>
                Early Islamic architecture was influenced   by existing styles such as Roman, Byzantine, and Persian
                architecture. As Islamic architecture spread from the Middle East throughout the world, specifically to
                places such as Asia, it was influenced by Chinese and Mughal architecture.

                Islamic-esque architecture in parts of Europe is a version of Islamic architecture that was developed by
                the North African Muslims who conquered the Iberian Peninsula and many surrounding Western Mediterranean
                islands and developed the style over hundreds of years of reign. Many prominent examples of this style
                can be found in Spain. In the mid-19th century, a revival movement included the work of Catalan
                architect Antoni Gaudi, whose work was highly influenced by Islamic style in Spain.
